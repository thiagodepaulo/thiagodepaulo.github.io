I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goiás (2007), a Master's degree in Computer Science from the State University of Campinas (2010), and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of São Paulo (2016), with a sandwich period at the University of Maryland, USA. I'm experience in the field of Computer Science, with emphasis on Artificial Intelligence, working mainly on the following topics: text mining, natural language processing, probabilistic topic models, information extraction, and graph theory.
